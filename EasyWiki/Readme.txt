EasyWiki is an extensible Wiki module for DotNetNuke built upon XsltDb. 

# HOW TO INSTALL EASYWIKI

1) Install XsltDb first (xsltdb.codeplex.com)
2) Add the four .cs files to App_Code\XsltDb folder
3) Create a folder named "EasyWiki" under DesktopModules, and copy all files from folder Desktopmodules\Easywiki there
4) Open the xsl file with a text editor and copy its content to the clipboard (Ctrl-C)
5) Create a new XsltDb module instance in a page of your choice, go to Edit Xslt and paste the code from point 4 (Ctrl-V)
6) Click on "update and publish"
7) Open module settings: you have to choose a folder under portal root, which is where you will store your wiki pages (I suggest using a dedicated folder)
8) Save settings
9) Start editing your pages
10) Write me for help :-)
